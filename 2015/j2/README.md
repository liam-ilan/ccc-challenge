# J2: Happy or Sad

## Problem Description
We often include emoticons in our text messages to indicate how we are feeling. The three consecutive characters :-) indicate a happy face and the three consecutive characters :-( indicate a sad face. Write a program to determine the overall mood of a message.

## Input Specification
There will be one line of input that contains between 1 and 255 characters.
Output Specification

The output is determined by the following rules:

- If the input line does not contain any happy or sad emoticons, output none.

- Otherwise, if the input line contains an equal number of happy and sad emoticons, output unsure.

- Otherwise, if the input line contains more happy than sad emoticons, output happy.

- Otherwise, if the input line contains more sad than happy emoticons, output sad.
