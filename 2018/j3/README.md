# J2: Problem J3: Are we there yet?

## Problem Description
You decide to go for a very long drive on a very straight road. Along this road are five cities. As
you travel, you record the distance between each pair of consecutive cities.

You would like to calculate a distance table that indicates the distance between any two of the cities
you have encountered.

## Input Specification
The first line contains 4 positive integers less than 1000, each representing the distances between
consecutive pairs of consecutive cities: specifically, the ith integer represents the distance between
city i and city i + 1.

## Output Specification
The output should be 5 lines, with the ith line (1 ≤ i ≤ 5) containing the distance from city i to
cities 1, 2, ... 5 in order, separated by one space.
