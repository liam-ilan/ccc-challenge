# J1:  Telemarketer or not?

## Problem Description
Here at the Concerned Citizens of Commerce (CCC), we have noted that telemarketers like to use
seven-digit phone numbers where the last four digits have three properties. Looking just at the last
four digits, these properties are:

- the first of these four digits is an 8 or 9;
- the last digit is an 8 or 9;
- the second and third digits are the same.

For example, if the last four digits of the telephone number are 8229, 8338, or 9008, these are
telemarketer numbers.

Write a program to decide if a telephone number is a telemarketer number or not, based on the
last four digits. If the number is not a telemarketer number, we should answer the phone, and
otherwise, we should ignore it.

## Input Specification
The input will be 4 lines where each line contains exactly one digit in the range from 0 to 9.

## Output Specification
Output either ignore if the number matches the pattern for a telemarketer number; otherwise,
output answer.
